# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a web-based AI assistant that provides a CLI-like experience through a browser interface. The system will be deployed on AWS using Terraform, with Python as the primary development language. The assistant will leverage AWS Bedrock for AI capabilities, AWS Identity Center for authentication, and support RAG functionality through Bedrock Knowledge Base. Additionally, it will integrate with a test AI agent built using the strands-agents SDK that provides time, date, and weather information for Birmingham, Alabama.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a corporate user, I want to authenticate using my existing company credentials through AWS Identity Center, so that I can securely access the AI assistant without managing separate login credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the AWS Identity Center login page
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL receive a valid JWT token from Identity Center
3. WHEN a user makes API requests THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token before processing the request
4. IF the JWT token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error and redirect to login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the AI assistant through a web-based CLI interface, so that I can have a familiar command-line experience while working remotely through a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display a terminal-like interface
2. WHEN a user types commands THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback and auto-completion where appropriate
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL stream the response in real-time like a traditional CLI
4. WHEN a user presses Enter THEN the system SHALL process the command and display results immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to communicate with AI models through AWS Bedrock, so that I can get intelligent responses to my queries and commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL send the request to AWS Bedrock using the Nova Pro model
2. WHEN Bedrock processes the request THEN the system SHALL stream the response back to the user interface
3. IF the Bedrock service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the Nova Pro model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access knowledge from curated knowledge bases and select which one to query, so that I can get contextually relevant information from different domains through RAG capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks questions that require domain-specific knowledge THEN the system SHALL query the selected Bedrock Knowledge Base
2. WHEN relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL use the RetrieveAndGenerate API to provide contextual responses
3. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user and provide a general response
4. WHEN knowledge base content is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect the new information in subsequent queries
5. WHEN multiple knowledge bases are available THEN the user SHALL be able to select which knowledge base to target for queries

### Requirement 4.1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily switch between different Bedrock Knowledge Bases, so that I can access information from various domains without needing to restart or reconfigure the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL discover and list available Bedrock Knowledge Bases
2. WHEN a user wants to change knowledge bases THEN they SHALL be able to select from a list of available options
3. WHEN a knowledge base is selected THEN the system SHALL use that knowledge base for subsequent RAG queries
4. WHEN no knowledge base is selected THEN the system SHALL use a default knowledge base or provide general responses
5. WHEN a user queries with a specific knowledge base THEN the system SHALL indicate which knowledge base was used in the response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a test AI agent that provides time, date, and weather information for Birmingham, Alabama, so that I can validate agent integration functionality through the assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests time information THEN the test agent SHALL return the current time for Birmingham, Alabama
2. WHEN a user requests date information THEN the test agent SHALL return the current date for Birmingham, Alabama
3. WHEN a user requests weather information THEN the test agent SHALL return the current weather conditions for Birmingham, Alabama
4. WHEN the agent is invoked THEN the system SHALL display the agent's response in the CLI interface
5. IF the agent fails to respond THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5.1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy and integrate a test agent built with the strands-agents SDK, so that I can demonstrate agent functionality and validate the integration architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN a test agent SHALL be included that uses the strands-agents SDK
2. WHEN the test agent is called THEN it SHALL be accessible through the backend API
3. WHEN the agent executes THEN it SHALL return structured data about time, date, and weather for Birmingham, Alabama
4. WHEN integrating the agent THEN it SHALL follow the strands-agents SDK patterns and conventions
5. WHEN the agent responds THEN the data SHALL be formatted appropriately for display in the CLI interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the entire infrastructure to be managed through modular Terraform using the AWSCC provider, so that I can maintain consistent, version-controlled deployments with better support for Bedrock components across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all AWS resources SHALL be defined in modular Terraform configuration files using the AWSCC provider
2. WHEN infrastructure changes are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented through Terraform updates with proper module versioning
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the Terraform configuration SHALL support environment-specific variables through module parameters
4. WHEN resources are no longer needed THEN Terraform SHALL cleanly remove them without leaving orphaned resources
5. WHEN working with Bedrock components THEN the AWSCC provider SHALL provide better support for frequent AWS service updates
6. WHEN organizing infrastructure code THEN it SHALL be structured in reusable modules for different components (networking, compute, AI services, etc.)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history and session state to be preserved, so that I can maintain context across multiple interactions and sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL create a unique session identifier

4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL archive the conversation data appropriately

### Requirement 8

2. WHEN the token is valid THEN the request SHALL be forwarded to the backend with user context
3. WHEN the token is invalid THEN API Gateway SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
4. WHEN users lack proper permissions THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response

### Requirement 10
